# [**PLDI'24 Artifact**] Variable Elimination for an Expressive Probabilistic Programming Language

This repository is a fork of [MAPPL](https://github.com/mappl-pldi24-ae) to
extend the use of generating function. It adds a new parameter (gf) that
outputs the generating function for the given program.

## Platform requirements

To set up the environment with all required dependencies, you will build the environment from scratch using [Nix](https://nixos.org/download). 
We use Nix version 2.20.5. All experiments were run on a Ubuntu 5.4.0-173-generic workstation with a 3.6GHz Intel Core i7-7820X processor and 12GB of memory. 
This Nix environment is not for Apple ARM processors.

## Getting Started

### Set up the environment

#### Install Nix

```
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```

Please refer to https://nixos.org/download for more info.

#### Using nix

To set up the dependencies for running artifact evaluation, run:
```
nix --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' develop -i
```
Verify the nix shell is running by typing `which mappl`. The output should be similar to:

```
> /nix/store/aqqh0r7lbgl3zwz9ckygd2l5pq3x8y9g-ocaml4.14.1-mappl-1.0/bin/mappl
``` 

## Experimental Evaluation

Benchmark scripts to reproduce results from the paper are at `bench/PLDI`.
